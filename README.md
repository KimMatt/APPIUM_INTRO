### Tuts+ Tutorial: An Introduction to Appium

#### Instructor: Matthew Kim

	Automated testing is known to be extremely valuable to any programmer, it is a tool that allows the simulation of a personâ€™s actions on a desired device. It is favored because it lacks the errors or speed limitations of an actual person. Appium is one of these tools based on the popular webdriver Selenium that enables automated testing on both iOS and Android native apps. Its main limitation is that it is built for only OS X and Linux.
